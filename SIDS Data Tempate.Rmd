## Abstract

_TYPE IN YOUR TEXT HERE - DELETE THIS FOR FINAL REPORT: Please provide an abstract with only a sentence or two each on these items: the purpose of your project, your research questions, analysis methods, results, and conclusions (approximately 300 words)._

## Introduction

_As a nurse, my background is in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).  In my capacity as a bedside nurse I often discharge patients to home, a process that includes extensive education regarding prevention of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).  SIDS, also known as crib or cot death, is the sudden, unexplained death of an infant younger than 1 year old and is the leading cause of death in children one month to one year of age.  Many risk factors have been identified including: prone sleeping, bed sharing, loose bedding, maternal smoking, and prematurity.  The national campaign Back-to-Sleep has great success in lowering rates of SIDS, however, the etiology is still poorly understood.  
_As a researcher, my interests focus on maternal/ infant health so I often encounter vital statistics and other data on SIDS reporting on a variety of variables.  However, I often wonder what other variables not reported may influence SIDS rates.  One is particular is if urbanization is at all associated with SIDS rates.  I would postulate more urban settings would facilitate greater exposure to education campaigns and other resources but also could increase exposure to air pollution and communicable diseases.  There, could of course be many confounding variables in the proposed relationship but the first step is establishing if any association exists.
_The focal question I would like to explore for this project is: “is there an association between urbanization and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).”  Beyond learning basic data management techniques in R I would like to take this opportunity to explore high-level vital data.  Planning a career in health research almost assures I will be working with data from the Center for Disease Control, likely in multiple capacities so I would like to become familiar with their systems of data management and use. Furthermore, as discussed above I would like to explore the relationship between urbanization and SIDS on a population level.  


## Dataset Description and Summary

_TYPE IN YOUR TEXT HERE - DELETE THIS FOR FINAL REPORT: Please provide a description of your dataset and where you obtained your dataset (link to repository or other references). Include an overview of the variables or measures included in your dataset and which ones you are conceptualizing as covariates, predictors or outcomes as related to your research questions and final analysis models. Include any data "pre-processing" steps or "cleaning" you had to do (data "tidying", handling of outliers or unusual values, addressing missing data, etc) or any subsetting you did (selecting specific rows or columns) - for example, if you didn't use the complete dataset, please describe which variables were selected any why and any cases (rows) that were selected any why (e.g. only children from ages 6-17 were chosen because...)._

```{r}
# view the top rows of the mtcars dataset in the car package
# put the information from head(mtcars) into a table
# using knitr::kable()
library(car)
knitr::kable(head(mtcars),
             caption="Top rows of the mtcars dataset")
```

## Dataset Summary and Visualization

_TYPE IN YOUR TEXT HERE - DELETE THIS FOR FINAL REPORT: Add tables (descriptive statistics for both numeric and categorical variables) and plots here to help decribe and visualize the key elements in your project dataset. Hint: look back at what you submitted for Milestone 2_

### Example Summary Statistics Table - Numeric Variables

_DELETE THIS FOR FINAL REPORT: This is an example summary statistics table for continuous/numeric variables in the mtcars dataset (Henderson and Velleman, 1981)._

```{r}
m <- mtcars
t1 <- N741pkg::tbl.continuous(m,m$mpg,"Miles per Gallon")
t2 <- N741pkg::tbl.continuous(m,m$disp,"Engine Displacement")
t3 <- N741pkg::tbl.continuous(m,m$wt,"Car Weight")
t4 <- N741pkg::tbl.continuous(m,m$hp,"Horsepower")
t5 <- N741pkg::tbl.continuous(m,m$qsec,"1/4 mile time")
knitr::kable(rbind(t1,t2,t3,t4,t5),
             caption = "Table of Summary Stats for Numeric Variables in mtcars")
```

### Example Summary Statistics Table - Categorical Variables

_DELETE THIS FOR FINAL REPORT: These are examples of frequency tables for categorical/ordinal variables in the mtcars dataset._

```{r}
gm <- dplyr::group_by(m,cyl)
t1 <- N741pkg::tbl.cat(gm,gm$cyl)
knitr::kable(t1,
             caption = "Frequency Table for Number of Cylinders")
gm <- dplyr::group_by(m,am)
t1 <- N741pkg::tbl.cat(gm,gm$am)
knitr::kable(t1,
             caption = "Frequency Table for Transmission")
gm <- dplyr::group_by(m,gear)
t1 <- N741pkg::tbl.cat(gm,gm$gear)
knitr::kable(t1,
             caption = "Frequency Table for Number of Forward Gears")
```

### Example plot

_DELETE THIS FOR FINAL REPORT: This is an example scatterplot from the mtcars dataset. The plot is of the mpg by car weight with colors by the number of cylinders used as a grouping variable. Note: as.factor() was used to treat cyl as a factor for grouping._

```{r}
# example plot using mtcars dataset
# scatterplot of mpg by car weight
# points colored by number of cylinders as a factor
# then linear model fit lines are added by
# cylinder group. FInally a main title, axis labels
# and a title for the legend are added.
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=wt, y=mpg, colour=as.factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method=lm) +
  ggtitle("MPG by Car Weight Grouped by Number of Cylinders") +
  xlab("Car Weight (in 1000 lbs)") +
  ylab("Miles per (US) Gallons") +
  guides(colour = guide_legend(title = "Cylinders"))
```

## Methods and Analysis 

_TYPE IN YOUR TEXT HERE - DELETE THIS FOR FINAL REPORT: For each of your research questions, please state what statistical analysis methods or models you used to "test" or answer each question. Be sure to also state what assumptions were made and how you checked your assumptions. Then provide the results of each statistical test or model and write your interpretation of these results._

## Discussion and Conclusions

_TYPE IN YOUR TEXT HERE - DELETE THIS FOR FINAL REPORT: Given your original research questions and results, write a summary of what was found and any conclusions drawn._ 

## Limitations

_TYPE IN YOUR TEXT HERE - DELETE THIS FOR FINAL REPORT: Please describe any limitations related to your dataset, original versus possibly revised research questions, and conclusions drawn (underlying assumptions, inherent bias, potential confounders, lack of generalizability, or other issues that could not be resolved or addressed)._
